# text-engine
My entry to a code challenge to make a text game in a week (April 2016)

I used this opportunity to experiment with Entity Framework for the first time.
This "game" works, but much of it is unpolished. It was a time-constrained challenge, and I left it in its final state. It was written with Visual Studio 2015, and no attempt has been made to update it.

There are build configrations "DebugAdmin" and "ReleaseAdmin" that build a seperate executable for running the game in "admin mode".
Admin mode adds additional commands to place monsters and create the map.
